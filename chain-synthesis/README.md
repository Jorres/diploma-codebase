## Description 

This is a simple CLI application. Its goal is to generate boolean schemas, starting with a naive encoding 
and keeping a log of what optimizations where done and their usefulness.

## Installation 

1. Create virtual environment (optional)
2. Run `[pip|pip3] install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Run `python app.py --help`.
You can also run `--help` on subcommands.


## Random notes go brr

Kulikov's presentation + lecture.
What else could DAGs bring except for bottom-to-top minimizations?

Local optimization of:
single pieces (when schema is already complex and no small part is optimal)
OR 
pairs of pieces (5-adder from two 3-adders).

Matching results from DAG paper is no longer a goal in itself.
