This is a simple CLI application. Its goal is to generate boolean schemas, starting with a naive encoding 
and keeping a log of what optimizations where done and their usefulness.

## Installation 

1. Create virtual environment (optional)
2. Run `[pip|pip3] install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Running `python app.py --help` will list subcommands of the application.
Run `--help` on subcommands (e.g. `python app.py run_random --help`) to see what each subcommand does.
